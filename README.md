# Lab1 

## Description
The project focuses on the logic behind computing two mathematical functions, f(x) and g(x). 
It includes features for calculating the value of these expressions based on user input, 
with a specific emphasis on handling cancellations and exceptions. 
The output of these calculations is displayed in a clear and concise manner. 
The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing for easy input of values and viewing of results.

Implementation language: Java
Means of communication: Uxin-socket
Synchronization method: future / executors / async, Non-Blocking I/O
"Carrier" of calculation: processes and threads
Binary Operation: sum of valid
